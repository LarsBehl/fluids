# Fluids
This project was implemented by [Tobias](https://github.com/Fl4mer) and [Lars](https://github.com/LarsBehl) as part of the 3D-Animation masters course at the University of Applied Science RheinMain. It shows the simulation of 2D fluids using a grid based implementation. The simulation is performed on the GPU by leveraging the WebGL-API using the library [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js). A [live demo](https://larsbehl.github.io/fluids/) is available.

# ng-three-template
This project ist based on the [ng-three-template by JohnnyDevNull](https://github.com/JohnnyDevNull/ng-three-template)

# Fluids-2D
A lot of the code is ported from [Fluids-2D by mharrys](https://github.com/mharrys/fluids-2d). It calculates real-time fluid dynamics running on the GPU with the help of WebGL and [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js). The simulation is based on Navier-Stokes Equations with the simplified assumption of incompressible, homogeneous fluid.

# Running the application
To start the application the following command has to be executed:
```bash
npm start
```
This will start the angular project and open up the application in the default browser.
